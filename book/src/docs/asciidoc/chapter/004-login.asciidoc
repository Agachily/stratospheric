== Login Feature

Basic idea:

- User registration feature to have a login-protected area
- Within the registration process the user is asked to upload a profile image for which we can create a thumbnail (e.g. 200x200px) using an event-based (S3ObjectCreated) AWS Lambda
- Protect Spring Web MVC endpoints with OAuth2 (JWT Token Authentication)
